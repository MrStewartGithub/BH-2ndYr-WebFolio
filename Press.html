						<center><h1>Hey there! My name is Ben Hunter and I’m an 18 year old high school student with a passion for media and story telling who is gearing up to pursue a career in the entertainment industry! This website has been created to showcase my skillset and for those who are interested to see all the work I have done.</h1></center>

							<center><h2>Ever since I was young I’ve always had a passion for storytelling through the medium of animation. Whether it be from impactful children’s films that engaged me at a young age to more mature animated content I consume now, I find their capacity to tell well crafted and thought provoking stories to be inspiring. In my free time I’d regularly draw my favourite characters or mess around with stick figures, I even had a weekly comic book I would draw for my parents! Essentially, I’m developing my skills to one day be able to create original content to share and inspire with others just as creators before me have done so. I’m heavily inspired by directors and creators such as Brad Bird, creator of The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and Alex Hirsch, creator of Gravity Falls. </h2></center>
								<center><h3>This website includes a link to the home page, in which I go into great detail about my biggest high school project, a fully animated short trailer for a hypothetical video game I’ve been working on. There is also a page dedicated to my previous work, showcasing where my strengths lie when it comes to Game Design. Those who take an interest in me as a potential candidate for business opportunities are free to email me on my account listed on the footer of this page.</h3></center>
